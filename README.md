# System Pharmacy - Basic OOP

Project started at the beginning of 2023, more or less at the beginning of the first semester, carried out in just 2 weeks. This project was carried out as the delivery of the first evaluation of Algorithms 3 with Professor Jivago.

## Overview
### Object-Oriented Programming Project

### System Requirements:

As the first practical activity of the discipline, each group is tasked with creating a system with a command-line interface menu, featuring the following options (additional options are allowed):

- **Register (Create)**
- **List array data**
- **List physical file data**
- **Persist data (save array data to the physical file and clear the array)**
- **Delete array item (delete by ID)**
- **Clear physical file**

To perform these operations, you must create the "Data Model" (Model) of the application using the object-oriented programming techniques learned so far. By the model, we refer to classes such as Student, Product, Employee, etc.

### System Guidelines:

- The system must have a theme that is simple yet allows the use of object-oriented programming concepts learned so far.
- The system must have a minimum of 6 classes created by the group.
- The system must have at least two method overloads (can be constructors).
- The system must have at least one superclass that is the parent class of at least two child classes.
- The system must use different access modifiers: private, public, and protected (package is not required) in contexts that make sense.
- The system must have at least one encapsulation that makes sense and is not just getters and setters.
- The system must have at least one abstract class, containing at least one abstract method, implemented by at least two other classes.
- The implementation of the abstract method/class must generate polymorphism that is useful within the system.
- The system must have at least one interface implemented by two other classes.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used to develop the project are very simple.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your Java project with Java Swing, MySQL, and JDBC locally. To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Java Development Kit (JDK)
  - Download and install the latest JDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
* MySQL Database
  - Install and set up a MySQL database. You can download MySQL from [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory
   ```cd
    Your-Java-Swing-Project
   ```
2. Set up the MySQL database
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Build the project
   ```javac
    -cp .;path/to/mysql-connector-java.jar YourMainClass.java
   ```
4. Run the project
   ```java
    -cp .;path/to/mysql-connector-java.jar YourMainClass
   ```
